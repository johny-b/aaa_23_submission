# aaa\_23\_submission

This is my submission for the AI Alignment Awards 2023 competition that won a first round prize.

I wrote [a LW post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/piAnXc2a4k5bFsKjL/self-shutdown-ai) describing it.
Original submission is in this repo, but you should probably just read the post (I now think lots of things in the `.pdf` might not make that much sense).
